# Daily CodeWars Challenges
Hello! Welcome to my repository where I tackle a new CodeWars challenge every single day. As a passionate coder, I believe in continuous learning and challenging myself daily. This repository serves as a journal of my coding journey.

## What is CodeWars?
CodeWars is a platform that offers coding challenges known as kata. These kata are ranked from 8kyu (beginner) to 1kyu (proficient), based on their difficulty. I attempt a new kata every day, of varying difficulties, to sharpen my coding skills.

### Structure of this Repository
- Daily Challenges: Inside the challenges directory, you'll find sub-directories named by date. Each directory contains the challenge for that day, along with my solution.
- Comments: Within each solution file, I have included comments discussing my thought process and any hurdles I faced.
- Tests: For some challenges, you may find additional test cases that I've added beyond the ones provided by CodeWars.
