# LeetCode Solutions

This repository is dedicated to keeping track of all my solutions to problems on LeetCode. Each solution is carefully crafted and tested to ensure correctness and efficiency.

## Structure

Each problem is stored in its own directory, named after the problem's title. Inside each directory, you'll find the following:

- A `README.md` file that describes the problem statement and my thought process behind the solution.
- A source code file (`.py`, `.js`, `.java`, etc.) containing the solution.
- A test file to validate the solution.

## Usage

To run a solution, navigate to the problem's directory and run the source code file with the appropriate command for its language.

## Contributing

While this repository is primarily for my personal use, contributions are welcome. If you have a more efficient solution or a solution in a different language, feel free to open a pull request.

## License

All solutions are open source, under the MIT license.
